# Project Design and Architecture
This document reflects the current architecture of the system.


## Overview

- Language: Java
- Architecture: MVC, Server side rendering
- Framework: Play
- Database: MYSQL
- Infrastructure: AWS (EC2 + RDS)


# Backend

- Front end
    - The front end is rendered by the back end using the Twirl templating language that comes with the play framework.
    - IntelliJ has trouble type checking the aspects of twirl that are scala specific.
    - Simple validation (e.g password min lengths etc) are handled automatically by Twirl by making use of the @Constraints annotation provided by play.
    - More complex validation, (e.g username is taken) is done manually.
    - A single 17 line JS file (main.js) is used to append the emoji picker button to the DOM.
    - Javascript libraries
        - The JS libraries used are: bootstrap, emojiButton, jquery and popper.js (also needed by bootstrap)
    - Styling
        - Styling is done using bootstrap v4
- Backend
    
    - JPA
        The backend uses the Java Persistence API for handling access to the database.
        - Hibernate 
            - Hibernate is the choice for the persistence library because of its prevelence and maturity.

    - Configuration
        - Development:
            - DB: For testing purposes an H2 in memory database in MYSQL mode is used.
            - Logging: 
                - Info messages for starting up/shutting down.
                - All request are logged with headers, body and session.
                - All SQL queries are logged with parameters.
        - Production:
            - DB: The RDS instance is used.
            - Logging: 
                - Info messages for starting up/shutting down.
                - Only requests that cause 500 errors are logged with headers, body and session.
        - Testing:
            This configuration is for running the e2e cypress tests.
            - DB: A MYSQL running on localhost with username="username" and password="password" with a database called testDB is used.
            
    

# Infrastructure

![Schema](./img/infra.png)

- AWS Instance : 1 x EC2 t2.small 
- WebServer: NGINX 
- Database server: 1 x RDS db.t2.micro 

The infrastructure consists of an EC2 instance running NGINX and a an RDS instance running MYSQL.

- EC2 T2 Small 
    - Nginx
    - WebServer

- RDS T2 Micro
    - MYSQL ver 5.7.22-log 

- Amazon cloud watch

- Alarms
   - All alarm triggers are eveluated using an average over a period of 5 minutes.
        - EC2 Alarms
            - CPU usage >= 80% (this may indicate a need for load balancing)
            - Network packets in >= 1 billion (DoS attacks cause a spike of network packets)
            - Network on average >= 1GB (this may indicate a need for load balancing)
        - RDS Alarms
            - Failed SQL Statements >= 1 (There should not be any failed SQL statements)
            - Failed logins >= 3 (2 failed attempts are allowed for administrators fingers slipping when logging in, otherwise it may indicate anauthorised access to the database)
            - Free storage space <= 5.24G (May indicate a need for load balancing/aditional space)
            - CPU utilization >= 80% (May indicate a need for load balancing)

- Budget
    - Under full load the cost of operating the system is projected to be Â¥4428.10 per month
